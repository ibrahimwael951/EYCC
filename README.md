# About EYCC
The Egyptian Youth Cybersecurity Challenge (EYCC) is the first-ever cybersecurity competition designed specifically for high school students in Egypt. EYCC brings together young cybersecurity enthusiasts from across the country to compete, learn, and grow as a community. Through a series of well-crafted challenges, the competition tests participants foundational skills in cybersecurity in a fun and hands-on way. Whether you are new to the field or already passionate about hacking, EYCC is your gateway into the world of ethical hacking and digital problem-solving.

# About CTF
EYCC follows a Capture The Flag (CTF) format — a popular style of cybersecurity competition where participants solve a variety of challenges to find “flags,” which are hidden bits of information that prove you have completed a task. Each challenge focuses on a specific area of cybersecurity, like cryptography, web exploitation, reverse engineering, or forensics. The more flags you capture, the higher you score.

If you are new to this style, do not worry — we have got you covered. You can check out the Challenges page to explore the topics and challenge categories, and head over to the Resources page for beginner-friendly material to help you prepare.
